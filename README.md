# Criticize My Photo App
## I build this web app with React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, SCSS.
On this site, you can see photos and comments coming from the API, and add comments.
Note that this API is a fake API. In other words, you cannot see the comment you added when you enter the site again.
### To run this project on your local 
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
But you can see on browser at https://tugaydmrl.github.io/criticize-my-photo/
